# Ubuntu-Helpbot
A simple help bot for Linux (Specially for Ubuntu).

The program is not Cross Platform , but you are welcome to modify it's commands for Windows or mac. It's not very difficult you just have to change the commands which are send to the subprocess function.
You need a good knowldge of python to understand the commands and stuff.

V 1.2 - Red Queen

Dependencies:

alsaaudio
pyaudio
wave
pyglet
speech_recognition


This version includes Speech Recognition and Voice Activated triggering.
Further updates are made.

Complete Documentation is pending of this version , will be updated soon!


V1- Brashi , This readme is for V1 only!

This Little program has the ability to launch apps by just typing a simple keyword or for example tell you time through text to speech engine called eSpeak

Dependencies:

alsaaudio

You can install alsaaudio by typing this in the teriminal:

sudo apt-get install alsaaudio

It can do other cool stuff but it is in it's Beta form so it lags some stuff , im a loking forward to people who can help me building the program better.
Some to the abilities of the program are still in development but little of it's code is still present , so if you get a akward looking function in the program which is of no use please ignore them cause it might be in it's beta stage more or less it will have a UD  comment in it for example the directory is not fully functional yet.'
Some of the collting it can do it start music player by just typing 'go music' or firefox by just typing 'go firefox'.
You can use give it instructions in natural language and it will understand it , like run vlc , 'start vlc' , 'start the freacking vlc'

I tried to put all the natural language i could but it still lags , so you're welcome to  modify it.
It's my dream to add a speech to text engine to  it , so that it can be controlled through voice but i failed many time so i am requesting you guys to edit it for voice recognition or just mail me a good method for adding a voice recognition engine [which can be used in linux] in it at ubdussamad@gmail.com.

There are many ' .dat '  extension file imports in this program so  you've got to modify their path in the funcs module

Put all three ' .py'  extension files togather in same folder.

I can't tell you all the commands [Though they are in natural language], so you've got to see the program for how all the commands work.

If you have any further problems or constructive criticism please mail me at ubdussamad@gmail.com
